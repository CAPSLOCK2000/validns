# validns notes

##

Something bugs me just below conciousness.
As in "what, do I have to write support for *this* as well?",
without being able to remember what's "this" is.

## TODO

- nice CPAN module for external programs output testing?
	- looks like Test::Command::Simple is what I want
- master file support (RFC 1035, section 5)
	- see whether there were changes to it
- zone validations specified in RFC 1035
- options support (`getopt`)
- usage() function
- `-v` option for verbose (multiple levels?)
- `-q` option for extra quiet
- `-f` option (die on first error)
- `-s` option - produce validation summary/statistics
- wired RDATA format
- include file support
	- `-I` option
- $ORIGIN support
	- `-z` option for initial ORIGIN
- $TTL support
- embedding lua for flexible validations
	- "policy validations"
	- `-p policy-file` option
	- `-r policy-rule` option (maybe?)
- better platform support
	- `stpcpy()` might not be everywhere
