# validns notes

## OMISSIONS

A number of corners were cut to assume the most usual
way of doing things.  Therefore, in many cases,
`validns` currently does not strictly adhere
to various standards.  In particular, it
should be possible (and easy) to construct
a perfectly valid zone file which `validns`
will report as problematic.  It is expected
that those cases will be all fixed over time.
But if you have a valid zone which `validns`
cannot parse, please do report this fact
to the author, with examples.  If there is
a need for the community to fix a particular
omission, it will be fixed sooner.
Needless to say, patches are always welcome.
