# validns installation

## Compatibility

Known to compile and work on:

- FreeBSD 9.0 amd64
- Ubuntu 10.10 1 i386

Is likely to compile and work on any modern Unix-like OS.

## Requirements

- Judy dynamic arrays
	- http://judy.sourceforge.net/
	- FreeBSD: ports/devel/judy
	- Debian/Ubuntu: libjudy-dev
- Test::Command::Simple perl module (for tests only)
	- FreeBSD: ports/devel/p5-Test-Command-Simple
	- anywhere: cpanm Test::Command::Simple
- [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for manual page generation

## Compilation

Type `make`.  If there are troubles,
have a long hard look at the `Makefile`, fix
the problems, repeat.

For manual page: type `make man`.  You need
to have `pandoc` installed (see above).
You don't have to have the manual page generated,
everything is documented in `usage.mdwn`.

## Installation

Copy `validns` executable someplace.

If you generated the man page in the previous
step, copy that some(other)place as well.
