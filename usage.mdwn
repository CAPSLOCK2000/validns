# NAME

validns - DNS and DSNSEC zone file validator

# SYNOPSIS

validns *-h*
validns [*options*] *zone-file*

# DESCRIPTION

Coming soon.

# OPTIONS

-h
:   Produce usage text and quit.

-f
:   Quit on first validation error.  Normally,
    `validns` continues working on a zone after encountering
    a parsing or validation error.

-p *name*
:   Activate policy check *name*.
    By default, only basic checks and DNSSEC
    checks are performed.
    This option can be specified multiple times.
    See **POLICY CHECKS**, below, for details.
    The following names are understood:

    - single-ns
	- cname-other-data
	- all

-q
:   quiet - do not produce any output

-s
:   print validation summary/stats

-v
:   be extra verbose

-I *path*
:    use this path for $INCLUDE files

-z *origin*
:    use this origin as initial $ORIGIN

-t *epoch-time*
:    Use specified time instead of the current time
     when verifying validity of the signatures.

# BASIC CHECKS

Every record and every supported directive should be parsable,
which consitutes the most basic check of all.
The `validns` program will report an exact reason
why it cannot parse a record or a directive.

Other basic checks include:

- there could only be one SOA in a zone;
- the first record in the zone must be an SOA record;
- a record outside the apex;
- TTL values differ within an RR set (excepting *RRSIG*);

# DNSSEC CHECKS

- there are more record types than NSEC mentions;
- NSEC says *x* is the last name, but *z* exists;
- NSEC says *z* comes after *x*, but nothing does;
- NSEC says *z* comes after *x*, but *y* does;
- signature is too new;
- signature is too old;
- RRSIG exists for non-existing type *type*;
- RRSIG's original TTL differs from corresponding record's;
- RRSIG(*type*): cannot find a signer key;
- RRSIG(*type*): cannot verify the signature;
- RRSIG(*type*): cannot find the right signer key.

# POLICY CHECKS

- there should be at least two NS records per name (or zero);
- CNAME and other data (excluding possible RRSIG and NSEC).

# BUGS

- textual segments in *TXT* and *HINFO* must be enclosed in double quotes;
- there cannot be more than 20 textual segments in a *TXT* record;
- *$INCLUDE* directive is not implemented;
- no backslash escapes in names are supported.
